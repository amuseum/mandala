# It's a mandala maker!

### Live App: https://www.metacoven.org/mandala/ 

This is a kaleidoscope-inspired drawing tool. It was built in Vanilla JavaScript with a touch of jQuery for event handling. LocalStorage is used for saving user settings. Some external libraries and tools were included for file saving and color picking.

The Amuseum version was forked from Hagar Shilo's mandala-app. Her excellent tutorials are included below.


## Tutorial
To truly understand how it works, why don't you try and build it yourself? This is my Mandala Maker [tutorial](https://24ways.org/2018/the-art-of-mathematics).

## Community
The original code includes facebook group sharing for you to show off all your cool drawings. We have deleted for Amuseum but it's there in the code for you to try out.
